## Getting Started

To run these Kotlin programs on your machine, you need:

1. **Kotlin compiler or IDE**  
   - Install the Kotlin command-line compiler from https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html  
   - OR use **IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio** for an integrated Kotlin coding experience.

2. **JDK (Java Development Kit)**  
   - Kotlin runs on the JVM, so a compatible JDK (e.g., OpenJDK 11+) must be installed.

## How to Use

### Run with IntelliJ IDEA

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SamratVsn/Kotlin-Beginner-Codes.git
